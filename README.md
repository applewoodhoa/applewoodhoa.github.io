## Welcome to the Applewood HOA website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/applewoodhoa/applewoodhoa.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

The site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that has been selected in the [repository settings](https://github.com/applewoodhoa/applewoodhoa.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
