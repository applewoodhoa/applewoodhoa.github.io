# Operations

The goal of this page is to document the operations of the HOA for
continuity and to help the community understand how things work.

## Responsible Parties

### The HOA Board

The HOA board is made up of volunteers within the community that are
elected by the homeowners. The board is ultimately responsible for:
* approving the spending of funds
* setting annual dues
* delegating certain operations to others

The board has 3 primary roles:
* President - calling meetings, establishing committees, executive actions
* Treasurer - tracking expenses, planning the budget. ensuring vendors are paid
* Secretary - taking meeting notes, creating and retaining records

### Property Management - Elite Housing

Elite Housing has been delegated by the HOA board as the property manager
for the community. The builder originally selected Elite Housing and when
the HOA was turned over to the community, the board continued the relationship. These responsiblities include:
* vendor management
  * bid gathering
  * ensuring vendors complete work
  * paying vendors
* enforcing covenants
  * driving the neighborhood
  * sending out violation notices
  * communicating with homeowners about violations
  * submitting variances to Architectural Review Committee
  * fining violations of the covenants
* maintaining HOA accounts
  * collecting annual HOA dues
  * collecting fines
  * using attorney for collections
  * paying vendors and utilities
  * creating annual budget

### Vendors/Contractors

The HOA utilities different vendors/contractors for performing various work
necessary around the neighborhood. The HOA board uses a competative bid
process where the property manager gathers multiple bids for the work and
the HOA board selects one and the property manager ensures it is executed
correctly.

committees and then split that inti into regularly
reoccurring work and seasonal work.
